		<h1>Because small choices have big impact.</h1>
		<h1>Because empowerment > optimization.</h1>

		<p>
			While the potential of emerging technologies is enormous, implicit decisions about how those technologies are applied can lead to unintended consequences, externalities, and harm. The Ethical Futures Lab investigates and applies emerging technologies in order to advocate for a more humane and empowering society.  </p>

		<p>
			We bridge the gap between research and action by providing a space for nuanced analysis and critical making. Our mission is to generate conversations among experts across disciplines, to build tangible examples of ethical futures, and to direct attention toward opportunities for better outcomes.
